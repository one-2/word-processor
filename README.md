## About
An early project in Python and Tkinter. It was a desktop word processor application. I created a GUI and file IO. I then started on basic word processing functions, such as word counting.

My vision was for an intelligent creative writing app, with helpful features such as syllable templating (for formal poetry), cliche detection, and integrated LLMs to critique and enhance the user's work.
